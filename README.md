All the files in `data/processed` can be reconstructed from the [Reddit Pushshift dataset](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/) using the notebooks `1.1_build-reddit-graphs.ipynb` and `1.2_build-reddit-popularity.ipynb`.
In order to reproduce our analysis, anyway, these processed files are attached.
To respect users' privacy, the data set files attached here use an anonymized version of their usernames (consistent across all files in our data set).
